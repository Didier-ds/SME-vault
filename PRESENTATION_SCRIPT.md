# SME Vault - 3-Minute Demo Presentation

## Speech Script

### [SLIDE 1: Title] (10 seconds)
"Good [morning/afternoon]. I'm excited to present **SME Vault**—a non-custodial treasury management platform that gives small businesses bank-level security controls for their crypto assets."

### [SLIDE 2: The Problem] (30 seconds)
"Here's the problem: Small businesses managing crypto face a critical security gap. Traditional wallets are a single point of failure—one compromised key can drain everything instantly. There's no approval workflow, no spending limits, and no fraud detection. Enterprise solutions like Fireblocks cost $10,000 a month—way out of reach for SMEs. And custodial services mean trusting a third party with your funds. We need a better way."

### [SLIDE 3: Our Solution] (45 seconds)
"SME Vault solves this. We're a smart contract-based treasury system built on Solana that enforces programmable security rules—entirely on-chain, with no third-party custody. Here's how it works: Business owners create a vault with configurable rules—like requiring 2-of-3 approvals for withdrawals, setting daily spending limits, and triggering time delays for large transactions. The key differentiator? These rules are enforced by smart contracts—they cannot be bypassed, even by the vault owner. It's non-custodial, so you keep full control of your funds."

### [SLIDE 4: Key Features] (45 seconds)
"Let me show you the core features. First, **multi-approval workflows**—staff members request withdrawals, approvers review and vote, and funds only move when the threshold is met. Second, **time delays**—large withdrawals above a configurable threshold require a waiting period, creating a fraud detection window. Third, **role separation**—owners manage the team, approvers review requests, and staff execute operations. No single person can move funds alone. Fourth, **emergency freeze**—owners can instantly halt all operations if they detect suspicious activity. And everything is recorded on-chain for a permanent audit trail."

### [SLIDE 5: Live Demo] (30 seconds)
"Let me show you this in action. [DEMO: Show dashboard, create a withdrawal request, show approval interface, demonstrate execution]. As you can see, the entire workflow is seamless—from request to approval to execution—all enforced by smart contracts on Solana, with transaction fees under a penny."

### [SLIDE 6: Why This Matters] (20 seconds)
"This matters because we're democratizing enterprise-grade security. Small businesses can now protect their crypto treasury with the same controls Fortune 500 companies use—at a fraction of the cost. We're targeting SMEs in emerging markets who are already using crypto but lack proper treasury management tools."

### [SLIDE 7: Closing] (10 seconds)
"SME Vault is live on Solana devnet and ready for beta testing. We're building the infrastructure for secure, compliant crypto treasury management at scale. Thank you. Questions?"
