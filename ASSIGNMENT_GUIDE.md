## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Complete Your Founder-Market Fit (Part A, Step 4)

1. **Fill in your background** in the "Manual Background Write-up" section
   - Be detailed and honest about your experience
   - Include technical skills, domain expertise, network, passion

2. **Optionally use AI** to help frame your FMF
   - Use the provided prompt template
   - Document the AI output
   - Synthesize it with your own thoughts

3. **Write your final FMF articulation**
   - 2-3 paragraphs connecting your background to the opportunity
   - Explain why YOU are uniquely positioned to build this

4. **Add personal reflection**
   - Assess your FMF strength
   - Identify strengths and weaknesses
   - Plan how to strengthen positioning

### Step 2: Part B - Adversarial Analysis

#### B.1: Adversarial AI Critique

**Action:** Consolidate your outputs from Part A (Value Prop, Target Markets, Competitors) and ask AI to critique them.

**Suggested Prompt:**
```
Critique my project's value proposition, target market, and competitive analysis:

[Paste your consolidated Value Proposition, Target Markets, and Competitor sections]

Why might this not be a true blue ocean? What types of competitors might have been overlooked? What are the biggest risks to product-market fit? What assumptions am I making that could be wrong?
```

**Documentation Steps:**
1. Copy the exact prompt you used
2. Paste the full AI critique output
3. Write your initial analysis of its validity
4. Reflect on what weaknesses are valid vs. overstated

#### B.2: Refine Project Definition

**Action:** Based on the adversarial critique, refine your sections.

**For each section (Value Prop, Target Markets, Competitors):**
1. Document what changed
2. Explain why you made the change (or why you didn't)
3. Show before/after if significant

**Example Format:**
```
**Changes Made to Value Proposition:**
- Before: [original text]
- After: [refined text]
- Rationale: [why you changed it - e.g., "AI correctly pointed out that we overemphasized affordability and underemphasized the programmable controls. Added more detail about on-chain enforcement."]
```

#### B.3: Critique & Refine FMF

**Action:** Have AI critique your FMF, then refine it.

**Suggested Prompt:**
```
Critique my founder-market fit:

[Paste your FMF paragraph]

What makes it potentially weak? How could I strengthen my positioning? What gaps exist between my background and what's needed to succeed with this project?
```

**Documentation Steps:**
1. Document the AI critique
2. Analyze which weaknesses are valid
3. Refine your FMF based on feedback
4. Document rationale for changes

### Step 3: Complete Process Appendix

**Action:** Ensure all sections in Part C are fully documented.

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Initial Project Idea (your original 2-5 sentence overview)
- [ ] Part A, Step 1: Complete (✅ already done)
- [ ] Part A, Step 2: Complete (✅ already done)
- [ ] Part A, Step 3: Complete (✅ already done)
- [ ] Part A, Step 4: Complete (needs your input)
- [ ] Part B, Step 1: Adversarial critique documented
- [ ] Part B, Step 2: Refinement rationale documented
- [ ] Part B, Step 3: FMF critique and refinement documented
- [ ] Research Sources: List all websites, articles, reports used

---

### Step 4: Create Final PDF

**Action:** Compile everything into a single PDF.

**Structure:**
1. **Part A: Final Project Proposal** (clean, refined versions)
   - Initial Project Overview
   - Core Value Proposition & PMF
   - Key Target Markets
   - Competitor Landscape
   - Founder-Market Fit

2. **Part B: Process Appendix** (detailed log)
   - Initial Project Idea
   - All prompts and AI outputs
   - Manual research notes
   - Analyses and reflections
   - Refinement rationale

3. **Appendix: Research Sources**
   - Web sources
   - Social media/community research
   - Technical documentation
   - Market reports

**Tools for PDF Creation:**
- Use Markdown to PDF converter (e.g., Pandoc, Marked, or online tools)
- Or export from your markdown editor
- Ensure proper formatting and page breaks

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Honest in Adversarial Analysis:** The point is to find weaknesses, not defend your idea. The stronger your critique, the better your final proposal.

2. **Document Everything:** Even if something seems minor, document it. The Process Appendix should show your complete journey.

3. **Show Your Thinking:** In reflections, explain not just what you did, but why you did it and what you learned.

4. **Cite Sources:** In the Research Sources appendix, include URLs, dates accessed, and key findings.

5. **Time Management:** 
   - Complete FMF first (needs your personal input)
   - Then do adversarial analysis (can be done in one session)
   - Then refine based on critique
   - Finally compile PDF

## Questions to Consider During Adversarial Analysis

**Value Proposition:**
- Is the problem real or perceived?
- Are there existing workarounds that are "good enough"?
- Is the value proposition clear and differentiated?

**Target Markets:**
- Are the markets large enough?
- Can you reach them cost-effectively?
- Are they willing to pay $50/month?
- Is the intersection of "SME" + "crypto user" + "needs controls" large enough?

**Competitors:**
- What if Squads Protocol adds programmable controls?
- What if enterprise solutions lower prices?
- What if basic wallets add multi-sig features?
- Are you overlooking any competitors?

**Founder-Market Fit:**
- Do you have the technical skills to build this?
- Do you have access to the target market?
- Can you compete with established players?
- What's your unfair advantage?

## Next Steps

1. **Now:** Complete your FMF section with personal information
2. **Then:** Run adversarial analysis (use the prompts above)
3. **Then:** Refine your proposal based on critique
4. **Finally:** Compile into PDF

Good luck! 🚀
